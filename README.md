# 📰 Fake News Detector

A project that uses NLP, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Transformers to figure out if a news article is fake or real.

## 🎯 What We Tried to Do
We wanted to solve a simple but important problem: is a news article trustworthy?  
To do that, we built a bunch of models using classical ML, GloVe-based deep learning, and even a BERT transformer.  
Then, we combined the best of them into an ensemble model to get more reliable predictions.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Libraries
- Text Processing: NLTK, re, string  
- ML Models: sklearn (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)  
- Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras  
- Transformers: HuggingFace's BERT  
- Embeddings: GloVe (glove.6B.300d.txt)  
- Interface: Gradio  
- Deployment: Hugging Face Spaces

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Input news text  
2. We clean and process it  
3. Run it through ML and DL models  
4. Combine predictions using a weighted ensemble  
5. Show the result (Fake or Real) with confidence score

| Naive Bayes        | 85%      | 0.87      | 0.83      |
| Logistic Regression| 93%      | 0.94      | 0.92      |
| GloVe + DNN        | 90.55%   | –         | –         |
| BERT               | 91.80%   | –         | –         |
| SVM                | 94%      | 0.95      | 0.94      |
